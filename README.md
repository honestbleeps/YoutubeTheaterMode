### Youtube Theater Mode ###

This simple browser extension uses [BabelExt](http://babelext.com/) as a framework. Check it out
if you're interested in developing extensions that work in multiple browsers.

Youtube Theater Mode simply scans all pages you view for links to youtube, and modifies them so
that when you click them, it plays in "theater mode", which increases the size of the video and
hides some of the distracting cruft from the interface.
